Modern agriculture faces significant challenges, including the increasing demand for food, labor shortages, and the need to improve resource efficiency. Traditional planting methods, whether manual or using heavy machinery, can be costly and inefficient. Both labor and first investment machinery  can be really expensive in comparison to an autonomous drone, which is smaller, cheaper to buy and doesn’t need an operator.

In recent years, automation and technology have begun transforming the agricultural sector. Drones have proven useful for crop monitoring, spraying, and data collection. However, automated drone-based seeding is still in its early stages of development, presenting an opportunity to enhance precision agriculture and improve farming efficiency. This early developing phase is the reason that made us invest in this project.

## To fully replicate the project, you have to follow the next steps:

## 1st. 3D Printing

Firstly, you have to 3D print all the parts that are uploaded in the _SolidWorks_ parts folder. THis will take time as there are severous parts

## 2nd. PCB Building

Once printed all parts, the next step is to build a PCB that follows the electrical scheme and connect all the components mentioned. Its mandatory that the position of the MPU6050 module is completely centered in the PCB frame.

## 3rd. Assembling

Once all the components and parts are done, you have to assemble all the parts as shown in the _Drone final.html_ file.

First, you will start attaching the PCB to the
