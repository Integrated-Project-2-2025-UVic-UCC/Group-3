Modern agriculture faces significant challenges, including the increasing demand for food, labor shortages, and the need to improve resource efficiency. Traditional planting methods, whether manual or using heavy machinery, can be costly and inefficient. Both labor and first investment machinery  can be really expensive in comparison to an autonomous drone, which is smaller, cheaper to buy and doesn’t need an operator.

In recent years, automation and technology have begun transforming the agricultural sector. Drones have proven useful for crop monitoring, spraying, and data collection. However, automated drone-based seeding is still in its early stages of development, presenting an opportunity to enhance precision agriculture and improve farming efficiency. This early developing phase is the reason that made us invest in this project.

To fully replicate the project, you have to follow the nexrt steps:
